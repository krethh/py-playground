## sendGmail.py
A simple gmail command-line client to send mail from your gmail account.

*Note*

However, due to security reasons gmail is enabled with security, that will block progmatic access to your gmail.
So you need to lessen your gmail security here https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps where you `turn on` access for less secure apps with `your gmail account`.

Make sure you use the above `gmail account` as your `from gmail address`. Refer the help of `sendGmail.py`

*Usage*

`py-playground$ ./sendGmail.py 
Usage details
sendGmail -f <sender gmail> -p <send gmail pass> -t <receiver mail> -s <subject> -b <body inside quotes>`
